# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

This project is a comprehensive introduction to setting up and working with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It guides you through creating a modern web application with reusable components, routing, API integration, and proper project structure. The project covers fundamental concepts from initial setup to building interactive components and fetching data from external APIs.

## Best Practices

1. Project Structure:
- Organize components by domain (layout, common, etc.)
- Keep interfaces in a dedicated folder
- Separate pages according to routes


2. Component Design:
- Create reusable, modular components
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Follow single responsibility principle


3. Code Quality:
- Use ESLint for linting
- Maintain consistent code style
- Add meaningful comments where necessary


4. Performance:
- Optimize API calls
- Implement lazy loading where appropriate
- Use Tailwind CSS for efficient styling


5. Documentation:

- Maintain a clear README
- Document component props and usage
- Keep commit messages descriptive
